# cra-template-enterprise

This is an extremely opinionated template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with lot of features & choices you may consider nonsense or unnecessary.

Don't use if you don't feel they are right .

## How to use

To use this template, add `--template cra-template-enterprise` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-enterprise

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template cra-template-enterprise
```

## What is included?

### Disclaimer

First of all, if you want to get answer "why" something is used, please take a look at [Architecture Decisions Records](/template/ADR). I encourage you to keep this directory and use it to track also your own architecture diecisions ([Why I should do it?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record#what-is-an-architecture-decision-record)).

Also, feel free to propose additional stuff. If you want to remove something, do it on your own after bootstrap or fork this repo.
